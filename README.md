# MySQL Scripts and Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram
## Introduction

This project contains a collection of MySQL scripts and an enhanced entity relationship diagram (EER) for the 2 databases(create-database & [world db](https://github.com/zer-king/MySQL-Queries-and-Enhanced-Entity-Relationship-Diagram/blob/main/world%20db.sql)). The EER diagram provides a visual representation of the relationships between the tables in the databases.

## MySQL Scripts

### The following MySQL scripts are included in the project for create-databases:

Task 1 - Part 1 - Using the Query 2 you created change the points to reads times by 10 and plus 100.<br>
Task 1 - Part 2 - Create a discount factor so the table now shows a discount header and changing the (point + 10) *100<br>
Task 2 - Return all the products in our database in the result set. I want you to show columns; name, unit price, and new column called new price which is based on increasing the product price of each by 10%.<br>
Task 3 - Find all the customers with a birth date of > '1990-01-01'<br>
Task 4 - Select sql_inventory and write a query to find out the name of the product with most amount in stock.<br>
Task 5 - Select sql_inventory and write a query to find out the name of the most expensive product.<br>
Task 6 - Select sql_store and write a query to find out the first name, last name, address and the birthdate of the oldest customer.<br>


### The following MySQL scripts are included in the project for [world db](https://github.com/zer-king/MySQL-Queries-and-Enhanced-Entity-Relationship-Diagram/blob/main/world%20db.sql):

Task 1 – Get the number of cities in the USA<br>
Task 2 - Find out what the population and life expectancy for people in Argentina (ARG) is<br>
Task 3 - What country has the highest life expectancy?<br>
Task 4 - Select 25 cities around the world that start with the letter 'F' in a single SQL query<br>
Task 5 - Display columns Id, Name, Population from the city table and limit results to first 10 rows only.<br>
Task 6 - Find only those cities from city table whose population is larger than 2000000.<br>
Task 7 - Find all city names from city table whose name begins with “Be” prefix<br>
Task 8 - Find only those cities from city table whose population is between 500000-1000000.<br>
Task 9 - Find a city with the lowest population in the city table.<br>
Challenge 1 - Create a SQL statement to find the capital of Spain <br>
Challenge 2 - Create a SQL statement to list all the languages spoken in the Caribbean region.<br>
Challenge 3 - Create a SQL statement to find all cities from the Europe continent.<br>

## Conclusion

This project provides a collection of useful MySQL scripts and an enhanced entity relationship diagram for the world database. The scripts can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as finding the number of cities in a country, the population and life expectancy for a country, the country with the highest life expectancy, cities that start with a certain letter, and more. The EER diagram provides a visual representation of the relationships between the tables in the database, which can be helpful for understanding the data and designing queries.
